        <p id="post">So, it is <em>2022</em>. A new year means a new age for me. I know my birthday isn't until <strong>May</strong>, and it's just <strong>February</strong>. I shouldn't even be thinking about it right now, but I can't help it.</p>

<p>Anyway, Bontle's birthday is the second day after mine. So our birthdays are pretty close. Bontle is my older sister, and she'll be turning sixteen. We all want to do something special for her.</p> 
<p>Now suddenly everyone wants a <em>special birthday</em>. I'm not sure about others, but it's not very sudden for me. I always wanted a <em>special birthday</em>. Although, I'm not sure what that would look like.</p>

        <p id="post">Riverdale. It's a great show. Oh, sorry, I meant <em><strong>was</strong></em> a great show. Season one was great. It's everything you want and a bit more. It had a murder mystery sort of thing going on. I loved it. We all loved it. </p>

<p>Then season two. A little chaotic, which was <em><strong>very</strong></em> enjoyable. There was a serial killer, and the group worked together to stop the killer, then a major plot twist at the end. It kept you at the edge of your seat.</p>

<p>The third season happened, now right here is when everything started to get a bit <em>icky</em>. Suddenly, teenagers were dying because of some dangerous cult and there was a gang war. But somehow, unrealistically, the teenagers in the story were able to take SATs and pass. It's very questionable, but just go with it I guess. Then <strong>BAM</strong>! The whole series changed into a musical. What? Okay, cool, I don't know any show that decided to change their genre but I guess that's cool. It's just some of the actors shouldn't be singing, if you know what I mean. </p>

<p>I'm not going to cover the other seasons because the point is, the writers of this should don't know what they're doing. </p>
